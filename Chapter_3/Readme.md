1.  Above each line, use the # to write a comment to yourself explaining what the line does.
2.  Remember in Exercise 0 when you started IRB? Start IRB this way again and using the above characters and what you know, use Ruby as a calculator.
3.  Find something you need to calculate and write a new .rb file that does it.
    Notice the math seems "wrong"? There are no fractions, only whole numbers. Find out why by researching what a "floating point" number is.
4.  Rewrite ex3.rb to use floating point numbers so it's more accurate (hint: 20.0 is floating point).

5.  Find out why by researching what a "floating point" number is.

    It is a floating decimal point.  You think about it when dealing with money, since we use two decimal places for cents.
    When dealing with large sums of money you will need more than two decimal places.  I had a issues where a Cost Accounting report was always off by cents to a few dollars.  The problem was the report was written with four decimal places.  I found where it needed seven decimal places to correct the problem.  You need to be aware of the data you are using to determine what you need.

6.  Rubocop:  I had errors for use of double quotes when I should have used single quotes
