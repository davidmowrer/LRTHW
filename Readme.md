This project is the exercises I did as
part of reading through Learning Ruby the
Hard Way by Zed A. Shaw.

This work was done as a homework assignment
for the [Davinci Coders](http://www.davincicoders.com/)
class that I am taking, titled "Building
the Toolbelt of a Junior Ruby on Rails
Developer" taught by [Jason Noble](http://jasonnoble.org).

What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?
1. Reading and writing.
2. Attention to detail.
3. Spotting the difference.

Please explain these three skills in your own words:

Reading and writing: You need to be able type or you will
have a problem learning code.  My biggest weakness is typing.
I know it makes me slower in writing code, I am not aware of
it effecting my ability to learn code.  My typing dose improve
the more code I write.  I became real good at copy and pasting in
the past which helped.  I see the no copy rule, I actually think 
it is in my best interest.  Especially with all the different
symbols used in the Ruby language, compared to languages like COBOL and SQL.
This is number one thing I need to improve.

Attention to details:  I agree that this does separate the good programmers from the bad programmers.
It has been my experience that if you don't care enough to do it right.  How do you expect to have the
time to fix what you didn't do the first time.  If you have ever supported systems you quickly learn
to appreciate well written and documented code.  It easy to get in a hurry to get things done especially
whe facing dead lines.  Missing little can turn into big things when code is in production.  I have
always tried to test as much as possible be for I release code.
 
Spotting the difference:  This can also be the difference between a good programmer and a bad programmer.
You need to know how to read code and understand what it is doing.  If you can do that you can spot most
difference rather quickly.  It is something that comes with experience.  A good rule when you are learning
a new language it always helps to get someone else to look at your code if you are experiencing a problem.
One rule I have used one I became proficient with a language and I needed help.  If they could find the
issue quickly I knew I encountered a real problem.  On the other had if they found it quickly it made me feel
uneasy.  That might go back to attention to details.

Why do you need to not copy and paste?

You learn by doing, typing.  If you copy and paste you learn how to copy and paste.  There is a place to
copy and paste, when learning a new language is not the time.  I will work hard a resisting to copy and
paste.  When you are experiences it can save a lot of time.  It can also be a little risk if you need to
make changes to what you copied and you forget.
