Questions:
What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?

1. Reading and writing.

2. Attention to Details.

3. Spotting Difference.


Please explain these three skills in your own words.

Reading and writing:
If you have a problem writing aka typing you will have a problem learning code.  I know I am not the
the best typist and I need to practice to get better.  It is true about all the different symbols
used in Ruby, you need to learn where they are on the key board.  I am not sure about the
statement if you can't type these characters you will not be able to even learn the most basic 
things about how software works.  If you know what the characters are and what they do it's
more important than the speed you can type accurately.  I do agree that I need to improve both 
my typing speed and accuracy.   

Attention to Details:
I agree with the statement "The one skill that separates bad programmers from good programmers is
attention to detail" 100%.  It can be the little things that get you.  You need to know and
understand what you are trying to code.  You need to test thoroughly to prevent the introduction
to bugs.  If you do not have the time to do it, how do you expect to have the time to fix it
later.  I take it personally if I miss something, there are times that you or the owner weren't 
aware of a special condition.  I personally fell it part of the programmers responsibility.  As 
beginner some times it can become over whelming and you miss the details.

Spotting Difference:
Spotting difference in code is a learned skill, like everything you need to practice to get
better.  In the past I have become very good at this.  Sometimes it takes a second set of eyes
especially when it is some thing new especially if you are a new programmer.


Why do you need to not copy and paste?
It is very important not to copy when you are learning new code.  It is more important that you
actually type it more than the speed.  When you are comfortable you can copy, but be careful
you can also copy bad code.  Make sure what you are coping.  It is tempting to copy and paste,
especially for someone who has gotten in the habit.  I am going to try and avoid the temptation.
