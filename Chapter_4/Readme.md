Extra Credit:

1. ex4.rb:8:in `<main>': undefined local variable or method `car_pool_capacity' for main:Object (NameError)
   The local variable is undefined in ex4.rb line 8.  It's usually missing or more common mis-spelled.  In this case "car_pool_capacity" should have been "carpool_capacity"

2. I used 4.0 for space_in_a_car, but is that necessary? What happens if it's just 4?
   It's not necessary, it's used as a multiplier and it was assigned a whole number.  It would make no difference.
