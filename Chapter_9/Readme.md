I finally made one error on this assignment.  Mis-spelled a variable when trying to use it.
Rubocop errors:
Two for Line is too long. [84/80]

Extra Credit:

Q) Can you get the text "Here are the days: " and the days to print on the same line?
If you use print instead of puts. Out side the string enter ,"\n" to advance a line.
