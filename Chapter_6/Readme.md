Find all the places where a string is put inside a string. There are four places.
Are you sure there's only four places? How do you know? Maybe I like lying.
Explain why adding the two strings w and e with + makes a longer string.
Simple because you are adding two strings which could have been combined into one

4) Add this explantion to Readme.md
   There was one in the variable for x, two for the variable of Y and 1 for the variable of Joke_evaluation
Q) Do you like string interpolation or format strings? Why?
I like format strings, they allow you to do more than including a variable in
a string, you can include special formatting.  Also I lke the actual variable
at the end outside the string.
