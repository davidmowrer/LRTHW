Find all the places where a string is put inside a string. There are four places.
Are you sure there's only four places? How do you know? Maybe I like lying.

Simple because you are adding two strings which could have been combined into one

Q) Do you like string interpolation or format strings? Why?
  I like format strings, they allow you to do more than including a variable in
  a string, you can include special formatting.  Also I like the actual variable
  at the end outside the string.  If you do not need any special formatting then
  string interpolation is less code.

Add the answer to this question into Readme.md.
