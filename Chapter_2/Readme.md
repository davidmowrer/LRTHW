1.  Find out if you were right about what the # character does and make sure you know what it's called (octothorpe or pound character).
    It worked correctly for me.
    The # or pound sign comments out code, must have a space following the #

2.  Take your ex2.rb file and review each line going backwards. Start at the last line, and check each word in reverse against what you should have typed.
    Since I had no errors I did not read it backward to find errors.  This could be helpful when you do find errors, it's easy to miss type.
    I had no errors.  Reading backwards is different, could works as you have to concentrate more to read backwards.     
3.  
    Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.
    There were no errors.
    
4.  Read what you typed above out loud, including saying each character by its name. Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.
    This is helpful even if there were no errors. 
    This could be useful, now we can read it do our duck and for sure someone will think that I am crazy.
    
5.  Can you find a key combo in RubyMine to comment out a line of code?
    Command+/ puts a # followed by a space on the beginning of the line.
