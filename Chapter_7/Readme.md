Extra Credit
For these next few exercises, you will have the exact same extra credit.

Go back through and write a comment on what each line does.
Read each one backwards or out loud to find your errors.
From now on, when you make mistakes write down on a piece of paper what kind of mistake you made.
When you go to the next exercise, look at the last mistakes you made and try not to make them in this new one.
Remember that everyone makes mistakes. Programmers are like magicians who like everyone to think they are perfect and never wrong, but it's all an act. They make mistakes all the time.

I didn't have any errors after typing this in, did have some rubocop errors.
One for Favor format over String#%, which is ok at this time.

Extra Credit:
1) Add comments to ex7.rb
2) Read ex7.rb to one of you fellow students
3) Feel free to document the mistakes you make in Evernote. 
4) ...
5) This is a lie, your instructor never makes mistakes. ;-)

Q) What happened when you changed print to puts? Why?

Q) What happened when you removed the last line of the program?

The last puts prints a blank line.  If you replace print with puts you get:
Cheese
Burger
Instead of CheeseBurger
