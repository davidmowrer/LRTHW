Extra Credit
For these next few exercises, you will have the exact same extra credit.

Go back through and write a comment on what each line does.
Read each one backwards or out loud to find your errors.
From now on, when you make mistakes write down on a piece of paper what kind of mistake you made.
When you go to the next exercise, look at the last mistakes you made and try not to make them in this new one.
Remember that everyone makes mistakes. Programmers are like magicians who like everyone to think they are perfect and never wrong, but it's all an act. They make mistakes all the time.

I didn't have any errors after typing this in, did have some rubocop errors.
One for Favor format over String#%, which is ok at this time.

Extra Credit:
1) Add comments to ex7.rb
2) Read ex7.rb to one of you fellow students
3) Feel free to document the mistakes you make in Evernote.
  This is a good suggestion.  I write them down on a paper, but the paper gets lost.
  You actually learn from your mistakes.
4) ...
5) This is a lie, your instructor never makes mistakes. ;-)
  Everyone makes mistakes, good programmers make less mistakes.  
  

Q) What happened when you changed print to puts?
  It writes Cheese on one line and Burger on the next line. 
  Why?
  When you use puts it writes out the line and does a return to the next line.
  Print writes out the line but does not do a return to the next line.
  
Q) What happened when you removed the last line of the program?
  The message Process finished with exit code 0 is written on the line below
  CheeseBurger instead a blank line between the two.  I prefer the blank line
  it cleaner.  You see the last line of output then a blank line and then the
  message, it's clear the program finished.
