1. Make your script print another line.
    
    Add another line with a puts example:
    puts 'print another line.'

2. Make your script print only one of the lines.

    The easiest way is to comment all the puts line except one
    with a # or octothorpe.
    You could remove all the 'puts' except which will only print one line.
     

3. Put a '#' (octothorpe) character at the beginning of a line. 
    What did it do? Try to find out what this character does.
    
    This makes the line a comment which is non executable.
    
The first time you said there was a missing a single quote on line 7.

    With the missing quote to code won't run, will return an error.  
    Simply added the missing single quote and the code executed.
    
How do you fix Rubocop issues?

    Rubocop displays the error and the line number in the code where the
    error occurred.  You find the line of code and make the necessary change.
    you can re-run guard by entering the enter key.  If it fixes the error,
    the error will be removed for the display and the number of errors will
    change.
